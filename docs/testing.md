## Frontend Testing

### Component Testing (React Testing Library)

Test coverage for:
- GraphCanvas render with sample data
- NodeDetailsPanel data display
- User interactions (click, double-click)
- Loading and error states

### E2E Testing (Playwright - Future Phase)

Critical user flows:
1. Load graph page → View graph → Click node → View details
2. Search for node → Select from results → Navigate to graph
3. Upload note → Wait for processing → Verify graph updated
