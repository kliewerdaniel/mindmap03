# Artificial Intelligence Research Notes

Machine learning and deep learning are transforming software development. Neural networks can now generate code, detect bugs, and optimize performance. The recent advances in large language models like GPT and Claude have made AI assistants incredibly useful for developers.

Important concepts:
- Neural networks process information in layers
- Transformers use attention mechanisms
- Fine-tuning adapts models to specific tasks
