# Project Planning - Mind Map AI

Building a local knowledge graph system that extracts entities and relationships from personal notes. The system uses NetworkX for graph storage and a local LLM for extraction.

Technical decisions:
- FastAPI for backend REST API
- SQLite for provenance tracking
- Cytoscape.js for visualization
- Sentence transformers for semantic search

The goal is complete local operation with no cloud dependencies.
